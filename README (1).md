# Diary

I have thought all over and even started
at some point but I never get to the end.
Do I really have to swear or what kind of
gown should I wear so that I can see it
end eventually.

I want to develop an application fo keeping
my dairy records. Keep track of my progress
and achievements and just to see if I could
eliminate any for of procrastination.

I wish myself lot of luck!

# Strategy

There are seven steps to follow:

## 1. Plan on the application

Decide what features your diary application
will have, such as the ability to add, edit,
and delete entries, search for entries, and
view entries by date or category. Plan the
UI and user experience of your application.

## 2. Set up a database
Since you'll be storing data in your diary
application, you'll need to use a database.
SQLite is a lightweight database that is easy
to set up and use with Python.

## 3. Write the code to interact with the database
Use Python's built-in sqlite3 module to create a
connection to your database and execute queries
to create, read, update, and delete diary entries.

## 4. Create a GUI
Use Python's tkinter module to create a
graphical user interface for your diary
application. You can create a main window
with buttons and input fields for adding
and editing entries, and a text area for
displaying entries.

## 5. Write the code to handle user inputs
Use Python's event-driven programming model to handle
user inputs such as button clicks, keyboard inputs,
and menu selections.

## 6. Implement features
Use the code you've written to implement the features
of your diary application. For example, you can create
a "New Entry" button that opens a window for adding a
new entry to the database, or a "Search" button that
searches for entries by keyword.

## 7. Test your application
Thoroughly test your application to ensure that it works
as intended. Try adding, editing, and deleting entries,
searching for entries, and viewing entries
by date or category.
